Terminosaurus is a JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of rich terminal applications by encapsulating many concepts familiar to web developers such as layouts, styling, or event handling. It provides two different APIs:

- A DOM-like API intended to be used for smaller scripts and applications.
- A React renderer for building more complex applications.

## installation

```bash
yarn add terminosaurus
```

## Usage

### DOM-like API

More details about the DOM-like API can be found in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guide).

```tsx
import {TermText, run} from 'terminosaurus';

run(screen => {
  const text = new TermText();
  text.appendTo(screen.rootNode);
  text.setText(`Hello world`);
});
```

### React API

More details about the React API can be found in the [dedicated React guide](/docs/react).

```tsx
import {render} from 'terminosaurus/react';

render(<term:div>Hello world</term:div>);
```
