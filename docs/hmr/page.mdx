<Callout type={`warning`} title={`Experimental`}>
  While Terminosaurus has been designed with hot module reloading in mind, the first iteration of this feature was implemented in an experimental bundler that isn't published yet.

  This documentation will be updated when the feature is available, whether it's from this bundler or another one.
