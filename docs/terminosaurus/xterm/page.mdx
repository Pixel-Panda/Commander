Terminosaurus provides a simple [XTerm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) integration which we use on this very website. It's exposed here for convenience.

## `<XTerm/>`

Creates an XTerm.js terminal that renders anything written to the `stdout` stream and sends anything typed into the terminal to the `stdin` stream. The terminal will have a variable amount of columns depending on its container, and a fixed amount of rows.

```tsx
import {XTermScreenIn, XTermScreenOut} from 'terminosaurus/xterm';
// ---cut---
interface XTermProps {
    stdin: XTermScreenIn;
    stdout: XTermScreenOut;
    rows?: number;
}
```
