    description: API reference for the TermScreen class.
---

The TermScreen class represents the render target for your application, similar in idea to what `window` is for the browser except that it isn't part of the element tree itself - a TermScreen isn't a node.

Terminosaurus provides two ways to create applications without having to instantiate a screen yourself:

- The `run` function from the `terminosaurus` main entry point.
- The `render` function from the `terminosaurus/react` entry point.

See their respective documentations for more details.
